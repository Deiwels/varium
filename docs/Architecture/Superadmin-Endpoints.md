## Why this file exists

Per [[Tasks/AI4-Emergency-Readiness-Review-2026-04-15]] `AI4-REQ.4`: if a production incident breaks the `requireSuperadmin` middleware or the Developer Panel magic-link auth, AI 4 needs an at-a-glance list of which endpoints are affected so they can be triaged, not grep'd for under incident pressure.

This is a **living inventory** — every new `requireSuperadmin`-gated route added to `backend/index.js` must be appended here in the same commit. If you see a grep count mismatch between this file and `backend/index.js`, that is a doc drift bug and the first action is to re-sync.

## Auth chain (how `requireSuperadmin` works)

`requireSuperadmin` is defined at `backend/index.js:1958`. The contract:

1. Client must send the `vurium_admin_token` HttpOnly cookie set by `/api/vurium-dev/auth/verify` after the magic-link flow
2. Token is verified against `VURIUM_ADMIN_TOKEN_SECRET` (env var)
3. If valid → `req.isSuperadmin = true` → handler runs
4. If missing / expired / bad signature → `401 { error: 'superadmin_required' }`

The magic-link entry points (`/api/vurium-dev/auth/request` + `/api/vurium-dev/auth/verify`) are **intentionally unprotected** — they are the only way to bootstrap a superadmin session. `/api/vurium-dev/auth/logout` clears the cookie.

Related:

- Developer Panel frontend at `/developer/*` calls `/api/vurium-dev/ping` to verify session on each navigation
- Middleware at `middleware.ts` passes through everything under `/developer/*` without checking cookies — the auth gate is purely backend-side
- Cross-reference: [[Web-Native-Auth-Contract]] for the separate web/native auth contract (different cookie set)

## Gated endpoints (as of 2026-04-15)

Grep source: `backend/index.js`. Count: **19 routes gated by `requireSuperadmin`** + 3 auth bootstrap routes (unprotected by design).

When any of these lands, this file must be updated in the **same commit**.

## Emergency use

### Scenario 1 — "Developer Panel returns 401 on every page"

1. Check `vurium_admin_token` cookie in browser devtools — is it present and unexpired?
2. If missing → re-run magic-link flow: `/developer/login` → submit Owner email → click link in email
3. If present but still 401 → check `VURIUM_ADMIN_TOKEN_SECRET` in Cloud Run env vars. If it rotated recently, all sessions are invalidated and Owner must re-login
4. If all above checks pass → `git log backend/index.js -10` around `requireSuperadmin` for recent changes

### Scenario 2 — "One specific superadmin endpoint returns 500"

1. Find the route in the table above → jump to the line number
2. Check Cloud Run logs for stack trace
3. Common causes: Firestore rule mismatch, missing env var, upstream service (Telnyx / Gmail / Resend) returning unexpected shape
4. Cross-reference with [[Architecture/GitHub Secrets Inventory]] to see if any secret affects this route

### Scenario 3 — "Entire `/api/vurium-dev/*` cohort is down"

1. Suspect `requireSuperadmin` middleware regression → `git log backend/index.js -10 | grep -E "auth|superadmin"`
2. If the magic-link routes themselves (2283, 2324, 2361) are broken → no bootstrap path left, `git revert` the offending commit and redeploy
3. Cloud Run `vuriumbook-api-431945333485` → Logs → filter `requireSuperadmin` errors

---

## Maintenance rules

- Every new `requireSuperadmin`-gated route added to `backend/index.js` → append here in the same commit
- Route moves → update line numbers
- Route removals → remove from this file + mention in DevLog
- If this file drifts from grep count → that's a P1 doc bug, fix before next deploy
